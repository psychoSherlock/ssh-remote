## I created this for personal use, so that I could access my local machine from anywhere through ssh without portforwarding using my public IP address which tends to change always as it is dynamic.

### Dont try to hack me :| 
### Its not possible cause:
* Ngrok links can be only accessed by one from the pastebin and after that it will disappear
* Even if you manage to access it, you cant just use brute force to login to my machine as ngrok is too slow sometime
* I use public/private keys for ssh anyway, so you are just wasting your time (sorry kid)
* I would only use this in a rare situation. (FYI)
